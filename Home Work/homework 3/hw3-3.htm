  <h1>Homework 3-3: Play Monopoly</h1>
  <p id="instruction">
    In the game of "Monopoly", pieces move around a board that has 40 squares. In this htm file, the names of these
    squares
    are stored in an array called <code>squares</code>. When the button is clicked, two six-sided dice are rolled. The
    page should be updated replacing the dice images
    to show the roll of each dice. The dice images for each number are inside 'images' folder. Use the state variable
    called <code>loc</code>, which I have already
    created for you, to keep track of the location of the piece. Modify <code>loc</code> to add the roll of the dice.
    For example, if I was on square 10 and I rolled a 3 and a 4, I would be on square 17. If loc is greater
    than 39, subtract 40 from loc and pop up an alert that says you have passed Go. Replace the word Go on
    the page to display the name of the square where the piece is now located. Keep records of all the visited square
    names in the ordered list.
