                Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents?

                Do they just not worry about every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and study carefully

                seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they seem to know just what to do. They never worry
                about

                spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry about not having enough time with them. Now,
                don't get

                me wrong, I'd rather be human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine having to sit in a zoo. (Did you
                figure out yet that

                while gorillas were on my mind, I could only find a picture of an elephant?)

                Do you think baby elephants wake up in the middle of the night and cry?

                Do their moms and dads take turns getting up with them to rock them back to sleep?

                How do you rock an elephant, anyway?

                And what about gorillas? </td>

            <td class="lastrow">Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla that was just born in Franklin
                Park.

                Its mom is holding on to it just like any proud human mom.

                And I have to wonder if they go through as much trauma as that human mom when it comes to sleep, and
                food,

                and diapers, and running into the street.</td>

        <p class="scroll">Elephants, the largest existing land animals, are mammals of the family Elephantidae. Three species are
            currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
            Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons.
            The family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked
            elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears,
            and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks, large ear
            flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk, also called a proboscis, is used for
            breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the
            incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist
            in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their
            great weight</p>
